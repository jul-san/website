                A couple of days ago, I attended an event that was hosted by the Asian American Student Union called SolidariTEA 
                where guest speakers would talk about how being Asian American has had different impacts throughout their life.<br/><br/>

                I missed the entire event last year, mainly because I didn't feel like going, but because a couple of my friends 
                were on the list of speakers, I decided that I should attend to support them and listen to their stories on how 
                they grew up.<br/><br/>

                The entire event really opened up my perspective on how being Asian American has drastically affected my life growing up, 
                from following the typical Asian stereotypes to having an even greater appreciation for my family who immigrated 
                from the Philippines to put me in the position I'm in today.<br/><br/>

                However, three of the speakers and their stories really resonated with me and I wanted to take the time to write about 
                them and how I felt their stories related to me when growing up.<br/><br/>

                <b>Have a Greater Appreciation for My Parents</b><br/>
                I've grown up always having the fear of not living up to my parents' standards when it comes to being 
                successful and a hard worker.<br/><br/>

                My parents both immigrated from the Philippines to the United States around their mid-20s and have been working the 
                graveyard shifts as nurses ever since I was born. <br/><br/>

                I often think back to the times where I would be sitting next to my upstairs' bedroom window waiting for my parents to pull into 
                the driveway late at night. When they did, I would sprint over to the front door to be greeted with hugs and a bag of fast 
                food that they had bought for me.<br/><br/>

                Having seen how incredibly hard both of my parents worked to provide me with the care that I needed growing up, I knew that I would 
                have to pay them back sometime down the line. <br/><br/>

                <b>Finding Happiness Requires Balance</b><br/>
                One of the presenters spoke on the effects of the pandemic and how it affected their experience in school. In particular, 
                they spoke on how before the pandemic they always had time to<br/><br/>


                 <b>Surround Yourself With the Right People</b><br/>

                At some point during the presentation, another one of the speakers brought up this quote
