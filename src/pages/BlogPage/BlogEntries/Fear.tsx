                    I fear that people only see me as nothing more than a boring work-centric individual: a person who only cares about their career, 
                    does nothing other than study, and enjoys being alone.<br/><br/>

                    I fear that it's true.<br/><br/>

                    In reality, I enjoy being with others: spending time with people, getting to know a person's story, making memories, talking about 
                    similar interests, making mistakes, and being vulnerable.<br/><br/>

                    <i>"Hey, let's hang out!" "We're going over to a friend's house. Do you wanna come?" "Come watch this game with us!" "I'm hosting a dinner 
                    night; you should come!" "You're invited!"</i><br/><br/>

                    My favorite questions and statements!<br/><br/>

                    The beginning of the year felt different. Maybe something about me changed, or my perspective compared to those I know differed, 
                    but something was off.<br/><br/>

                    <i>"So, how'd you get an internship at MIT?" "How often do you study?" "How's school been?" "Good job, Julian, you're so smart!" "Can 
                    you help me with an assignment?" "How's work?" "You're going to be rich one day!"</i><br/><br/>

                    I hate these questions. But I don't understand, that's all I get asked. What changed?<br/><br/>

                    "You disappeared" is what I've been told, but I feel like I was kicked out.<br/><br/>

                    I tried breaking out of my shell, but it's only driven people away.<br/><br/>

                    So many people surround me, yet I feel the most isolated. You are the average of the five people you surround yourself with, but I'm 
                    surrounded by no one. Does that make me empty?<br/><br/>

                    How do I show people that I'm more than work? I want to have fun, too. Do I even know how to have fun?<br/><br/>

                    A day without laughter is a day wasted. I suppose I've been wasting my days away.<br/><br/> 

                    I'm getting too lost in my thoughts, but I have no one to guide me. Tears fill my eyes only to be quickly wiped away.
                    A ticking time bomb in its final seconds.<br/><br/>
                                        
                    I want people to know who I am, but feelings aren't vice versa.<br/><br/>

                    I've been described as "nice, quiet, and unproblematic."<br/><br/>

                    Nice, only for me to be taken advantage of. Quiet, but I have the loudest mind in the room. 
                    Unproblematic, but I have no room to bleed.<br/><br/>

                    But maybe it's too late, and the vision that people see me as is set in stone.<br/><br/>

                    <i>Julian Sanchez, a computer science major who cares about their career, does nothing but study and enjoys being alone.</i><br/><br/>

                    Maybe nothing changed, and that's really who I am. I don't want to accept it, but I feel like other people have, 
                    so I guess I should too.<br/><br/>

                    I've reached academic achievement, but a social calamity.<br/><br/>

                    My fear is true.<br/><br/>
